DigSig FAQ
===========

Question summary
----------------

Q1- Wouldn't you need to sign, say, /lib/ld-linux.so? In that case, you  
can simply get it to load an execute almost anything that's ELF, even  
on filesystems marked noexec, if I'm not mistaken...

Q2- "Is it possible to write one's own ELF loader to read & interpret ELF
executables, mmap the code,  so as to bypass DigSig"

Q3- "What interest in combining DigSig with SELinux ?"

Q1- "Wouldn't you need to sign, say, /lib/ld-linux.so? In that case, you  
can simply get it to load an execute almost anything that's ELF, even  
on filesystems marked noexec, if I'm not mistaken..."

It uses dlopen, which does mmap(PROT_EXEC), at which point digsig will
check for a signature. 
If you rewrite it to not use mmap(PROT_EXEC), then the signature will
not match.  If you resign it, then you presumably know what you're
doing. (Serge Hallyn)

2.6.0 included a fix to stop that from working from noexec filesystems (Chris Boot)

Q2- "Is it possible to write one's own ELF loader to read & interpret ELF
executables, mmap the code,  so as to bypass DigSig"

DigSig prevents this because when you mmap the code, this calls (at kernel
level) do_mmap which triggers an LSM hook called file_mmap. DigSig implements
this hook and performs signature verification at that point. (Axelle Apvrille)

If you just mmap(file) and move regs.eip into that memory, it works. We
can't do anything about that (Serge Hallyn).

Q3- "What interest in combining DigSig with SELinux ?"

1. selinux integrity controls on crucial digsig files, which
digsig does not (and should not) protect itself

2. digsig controls over selinux entry types.  So now you can
protect domain transitions with small, verifiable entry points
which are then signed to boot. 

(Serge Hallyn)

Combine it with SELinux, exec-shield, FORTIFY_SOURCE, -fstack-protector
and, say, a COWed filesystem read off a CD and reset with every boot,
 and you start to get a bit less insecure than you would otherwise be.
