Release of digsig.0.2

We implemented a kernel module for 2.5.66 which checks signatures
before running a binary.  The main goal is to insert digital
signatures inside the ELF binary and verify this signature before
loading the binary. It is based on the LSM hooks. 

It has been added to DSI's CVS. In order to simplify its use, it is
available either as part of the DSI package, or in a standalone
version independently of DSI. Some dsi-based source code files are
still in the independant package. However, the module is independent
from DSI and you don't need to download the whole dsi tar ball to play
with the digsig module (even if we'll be more than happy to have your
feedback about dsi project :-)).

Our approach has been to use the existing solutions like gpg and bsign
rather than reinventing the whole thing from scratch.

However, in order to reduce the overhead in the kernel, we took only the
minimum code necessary from GPG. We took only the MPI (Multi Precision
Integer) source code and the RSA crypto source code. This helped much
to reduce the amount of code imported to the kernel in sourc code of
the original (only 1/10 of the original gnupg 1.2.2 sourc code has
been imported to the kernel module). On the other hand, we avoided
OpenSSL source code for the fact that the licensing was not clear to
us. We did some tests at user level and found out that OpenSSL is 4
times faster than GPG regarding RSA verification. As a future
direction, we plan to clarify this licensing issue and use OpenSSL
instead of GPG.

Requirements:
==============

Linux OS kernel 2.5.66 or  higher. 

Bsign version
0.4.5. (http://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/bsign.html)

GPG 1.2.2 or higher. 

Performances
=============== 

This is release 0.2. We have done some benchmarks. 

We ran lmbench on a Pentium IV, 2.4 GHz, 500 mega bytes of memory,
running Linux 2.5.66. Our benchmarks show that the execution time
(exec function call) multiplies by a factor of 4 when the module is
loaded (no changes for fork call, as the binary is not loaded into
memory).

A Very simple scenraio to show how to use it  
=======================================

1) Generate gpg key and export your public key in order to use it for
 signature verification.
 
$gpg --gen-key 

=> careful generate RSA key 

$gpg --export >> my_public_key.pub 

2) Sign your binaries using Bsign 

Before using bsign to sign all your binaries, try out with a simple
example.

$cp `which ps` ps-test
$bsign -s ps-test // sign the binary 
$bsign -v ps-test // be sure that the signature is valid  

3) Make the digsig module 

From ./digsig, do make -C /usr/src/linux-2.5.66 SUBDIRS=$PWD modules. You need rw acess to /usr/src/linux-2.5.66. 

CAREFULL: we advice you to compile the module in debug mode at your
first tries (see -DDSI_DEBUG -DDSI_DIGSIG_DEBUG in the Makefile). In
this mode, the module verifies the signatures but does not enforce the
security (if not any signature present in your binary, you'll have a
message in /var/log/messages but the execution is not
aborted.). However, the execution of the bianaries with invalid
signatures is aborted. Once, you're sure of your binary signature
procedure you can recompile the whole on non-debug mode.

4) load digsig, use the public key exported in step 1 as argument 

root@colby digsig-dev]# ./digsig.init start pubkey.pub
Loading Digsig module.

pkey->n MPI:
{ 0x6e, 0x4, 0, 0xb7, 0xee, 0x6c, 0x26, 0xf0, 0, 0xa4, 0xbc, 0xe6, 0x10, 0xba, 0xe8, 0xdd, 0x7f, 0xf7, 0xaa, 0x53, 0x63, 0x55, 0x67, 0x76, 0x91, 0x5b, 0xfa, 0xa9, 0x14, 0x34, 0xba, 0, 0xad, 0xb3, 0x6b, 0xf2, 0x71, 0x65, 0x9f, 0xf3, 0x44, 0x6e, 0x33, 0x25, 0xec, 0xdd, 0x1a, 0x95, 0xa6, 0x83, 0x2a, 0x99, 0xd7, 0xf6, 0x98, 0x5b, 0x2f, 0xe6, 0xae, 0xbd, 0x83, 0xf, 0x21, 0xd, 0x5f, 0xa8, 0xe5, 0xab, 0x9, 0xf3, 0x27, 0x71, 0xac, 0x29, 0xf4, 0x44, 0x9e, 0xbb, 0x7a, 0x40, 0x58, 0xd4, 0xda, 0xf5, 0xd3, 0x87, 0xaa, 0xef, 0xc, 0x3f, 0x58, 0x11, 0x21, 0x25, 0x76, 0x65, 0x7b, 0xef, 0x4, 0x60, 0x14, 0xcf, 0xaa, 0xfc, 0x4f, 0xd4, 0x5c, 0xe0, 0x94, 0x73, 0x2a, 0xd0, 0x1e, 0x8, 0xa4, 0x7a, 0x95, 0xc4, 0xaf, 0x64, 0x5a, 0xb7, 0xf8, 0xf7, 0xd, 0xb0, 0x5c, 0x1b, 0x2, 0x54, 0x9f, }
pkey->n MPI:
{ 0x65, 0, 0x6, 0x29, }
Done.


5) In debug mode: 

$ps 
$./ps-test 

$tail -f /var/log/messages 
Sep 16 15:49:13 colby kernel: DSI-LSM MODULE - binary is /bin/ps
Sep 16 15:49:16 colby kernel: DSI-LSM MODULE - binary is ./ps-makan
Sep 16 15:49:16 colby kernel: DSI-LSM MODULE - dsi_bprm_compute_creds: Found signature section
Sep 16 15:49:16 colby kernel: DSI-LSM MODULE - dsi_bprm_compute_creds: Signature verification successful

6) In restrictive mode, normal mode 

You need to use bsign to sign all binaries that you want to run in
normal mode. 

// signed binary 
[lmcmpou@reblochon lmcmpou]$ ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 6897 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
 6941 pts/2    00:00:00 ps

// not signed binary 
[lmcmpou@reblochon lmcmpou]$ ./ps-makan-1
bash: ./ps-makan: cannot execute binary file

// binary with wrong signature 
[lmcmpou@reblochon lmcmpou]$ ./ps-makan-2 
bash: ./ps-makan-colby: Operation not permitted

7) Unload the module. 

[root@colby digsig-dev]# ./digsig.init stop
Unloading Digsig.

This work has been done by (alphabetical order)
